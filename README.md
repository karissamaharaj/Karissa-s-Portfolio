This is where I will be displaying my projects and case studies.

Project 1: R Forecasting Methods Project
[R Forecasting Methods Project.pdf](https://github.com/karissamaharaj/Karissas-Portfolio/files/10253242/R.Forecasting.Methods.Project.pdf)


In this project, I compared different forecasting methods in R, such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Na√Øve Bayes Method, Logistic Regression, and Small Vector Machines, to determine which method was the most accurate.


Project 2: ETL Pipeline Project
[ETL Pipeline Project.pdf](https://github.com/karissamaharaj/Karissas-Portfolio/files/10253244/ETL.Pipeline.Project.pdf)


In this project, I extracted raw data from the NYC 311 Complaints database site, transformed vast amounts of data using extensive coding in Python Pandas, uploaded the data into Google BigQuery, and analyzed the data to determine which borough needed the most attention, according to my KPI's. I also created visualizations of the data using Google Data Studio.
